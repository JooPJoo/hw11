Mini Fan

Remote controlled fan with various speeds

## Summary
This project will replicate a portable fan we use today.  It will use both mechanical and electrical components.  It will also feature different speeds the fan will spin at for stronger/weaker wind force.

## Component Parts
Mechanical parts will include fan blades, a housing unit and buttons.  Electrical components include the arduino UNO, jumper wires, bread board, servo motor, and batteries.

Code that will be implemented control the servo motor speed and button fucntions.
