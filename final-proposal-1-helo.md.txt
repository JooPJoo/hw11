Mini Helicopter

A toy that flies (mini helicopter)

## Summary

For this project, a mini toy helicopter will be created with arduino.  Just like drones you see today, this project will try to replicate them.  It will be interactive by incorporating a remote control to help control the movement.

## Component Parts

Mechanical parts will include fan blades and helo body.  The body will house the arduino UNO, IR sensor for a remote to control its functions, a 360 degree servo motor and batteries.

Code that will be written and used will include the ability for a remote control to command the mini helicopter to fly.
